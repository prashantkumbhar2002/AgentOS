# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Error Hierarchy + Global Error Handler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec intentionally avoids mentioning specific class names, file paths, or code patterns — those belong in the implementation plan.
- Note: The user's input included implementation details (exact class definitions, file paths). These were abstracted into behavior-focused requirements in the spec. The implementation details will be preserved in the planning phase.
